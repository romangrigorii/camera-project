** NOTES **
The very basic method of reading data from the CCD chip resulted in 770Hz position update.
Theorietically, some very minor updates will bring this to 1100Hz. 

The goal is to stream data faster. 

The plan: 
Cliock the chip at 20MHz. Position curve will be updated at 5200Hz
which produces 3846 clock cycles per curve. SH goes low for 3826 cycles and goes high for 20. 
The output pins will contain lowpassed position curve 

1) 
Create an SH signal seperate from clocking
2) 
Start at SH = 1. Create SH signal by initiaing interrupt based on clock input. 
Let SH go low.
Count the necessary counts.
Let SH go high.
